# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?
* Node is an open-source, cross-platform environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser. We can use this to run 
  JavaScript on the server side.
## What is Express?
* Express is a web application framework that allows us to build a server quickly and easily. With express we can manage everything, 
  such as routes, handling requests, and views.

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
* I learned that creating a server with express is as simple as creating a variable.
* I learned that express has this thing called Router that we can use to separate the logic of our routes, making our
  server.js file much cleaner.
## What is Middleware?
* Middleware is essentially software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and some other application, especially on
  a network. Now, in my own words, it would seem that the middleware I've learned about thus far is nothing more than functions or methods that 
  intercept data being passed from the database to the server and do something with that data before passing it on. Apparently middlware makes our lives
  easier.
## What is a Resource?
* A resource is any component of limited availability within a computer system.
## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
*   A status of 200.
## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
* I am not completely sure but I think it has something to do with sub routes--I am just now barely grasping the concept of routes so ya'll need to chill
  and just be patient with me.
## What is CORS and why do we need it?
* CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing; in my own words it allows us to get stuff from a domain outside of the domain on which the current application
  is already running.
